# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
Predict the price of a house by its features. If you are a buyer or seller of the house but you donâ€™t know the exact price of the house, so supervised machine learning regression algorithms can help you to predict the price of the house just providing features of the target house.
To get more accuracy, we trained all top supervised regression algorithms but you can try out a few of them which are always popular. After training all algorithms, we found that SVR and XGBoost regressor have given high accuracy than remain but we have chosen SVR.

As ML Engineer, we always retrain the deployed model after some period of time to sustain the accuracy of the model. We hope our efforts will help to predict the price of a house for the buyer and seller.
